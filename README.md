It allows users to explore workout routines, track nutrition plans, calculate their **BMI (Body Mass Index)**, and set goals such as **weight loss**, **muscle gain**, or **daily energy maintenance**.

The goal of this app is to provide a simple, intuitive, and motivating environment for anyone who wants to improve their physical health and diet habits.
